Trying to get a new Algorithm using Java that encrypt and decrypt a massege !

The algorithm will ask the user to enter the message, convert it into binary, and then
reverse it. We use keys in our algorithm by asking the user to write them, then
converting them into binary. After that, it will do an XOR operation with the plaintext
and the key. At the end, the result will be a perm.utation to get the ciphertext. In
decryption step, we first take the cipher text to convert in into binary, then
permutation it after that we doing XOR-operation on it at least we are reverse the bits
to return the massage into plaintext again.
